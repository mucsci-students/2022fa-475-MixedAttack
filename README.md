## Developed by Devon Fair, Austin An, Noah Barger

## Tips
- Please go into options and adjust the volume there is sound it might turned up a bit too loud.
- You have infinite ammo.
- Monsters drop either a soda bottle or an ice cream cone, the soda bottle will replenish health, the ice cream cone will replenish your shield
- The health and shield card increase max health which is why it looks like you lose hp/shield in the bar, but it's just increasing the max amount it can be.
- There are 4 buttons inside of the game that you can interact with, once all 4 are activated the console inside of the big gray building you spawn next to will be activated
- There are letters next to the button, those letters are a password to the console you will have to figure out the correct order of the letters.
- Once entered you can escape using the console after surviving for 5 minutes.

## Controls
- Moving: WASD
- Aim: Mouse + Leftclick to shoot
- Jump: Space
